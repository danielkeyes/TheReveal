***This App has been removed from the Google Playstore and my website as I made it just for family and friends as way to announce my child's birth and do some coding in my freetime. It has served it's purpose.***

# The Reveal - Android App

<img src="storeassets/PlayStore_FeatureBackdrop.png" alt="The Reveal Banner"/>

This app can be used to either generate or enter a reveal code/reveal link that is used to do a gender reveal or birth reveal.

If the link is shared and the app is installed, the app will automatically read the code and do the reveal, else the link will open to The Reveal App website with explanation and a link to the Google Play Store listing.
